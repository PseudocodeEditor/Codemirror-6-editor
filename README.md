# Pseudocode Editor

## About Pseudonaja
Pseudonaja is a CIE compliant pseudocode editor for GCSE, iGCSE and A-Level students studying computer science. We aim to provide an easy interface to write, edit and run pseudocode, with syntax inline with the CIE specification for examinations. Pseudonaja is an open source project with the code available on GitHub. Pseudonaja is currently in the process of development meaning that there is not yet a full set of documentation available. The current documentation is being updated as frequently as possible as well as the program itself. Documentation for Pseudonaja can be found [here](https://pseudonajadocs.gitbook.io/editor/).
